There are more than 2000 software companies in Bangladesh. This is not much in a country with a population of 160 million. But the number is not small either. The title of this post should have been "Why it's Hard to Build a _Good_ Software Company in Bangladesh". The number of good software companies where programmers are happy with their work and are producing world class software are much less than 2000. My estimate is its less than 20.

Naturally, there are many reasons. Many reasons are beyond the IT industry. The daylong traffic jams killing the capital city, mass corruption, bureaucratic red tape --- these are factors that affect all businesses in the country. In spite of these, some sectors like garments, textile and agro industries are booming. But when it comes to IT, specifically software development, there has to be more reasons that are crippling its growth. These are the same reasons that make it hard to build a good software company in Bangladesh.

What follows is based on what I have learned in the past 19 years working in or with many software companies here and what I have learned about other companies through various means.

## Lack of Technical Leadership and Management

This is number one, IMHO. All workers in a software company are knowledge workers. My MBA holder friends may not agree, but managing knowledge workers requires a different skill set than managing manual labourers in garments and other factories. It requires the manager to understand the field to a much deeper depth that its necessary in manual labour settings. They need to understand how software is built, the ecosystems involved, the evolution in the industry, the challenges faced by developers, testers, designers and analysts.

Fresh software engineers in Bangladesh look for mentorship and leadership. They need it more than an engineer in the USA for example. If the leadership of the company can not provide it, they will have failed software projects and products with poor quality that have to be thrown away soon after launch.

In every successful software company in Bangladesh, I have seen the role of good leadership. Either the owners or investors were the leaders, or they hired the right leaders and gave them the required autonomy.

## Lack of Good Projects

This is somewhat of a chicken and egg problem. It is impossible to deliver a good quality project without good engineers. And it is hard to attract or build good quality engineers without good quality projects.

Until recent years, all quality projects came from outside the country. The proof is that almost all companies having a good salary structure have the majority of their revenue from outsourcing from USA, Europe or Japan. The situation is improving thanks to the Digital Bangladesh drive of the current government. Larger and more complex projects are now getting initiated in the government sector. People, both in the government and outside government are getting aware how automation can help the society.

## Education

The modern education system in most post colonial countries in the world are messed up. The system in our country is messed up a tad bit more. To start with, we got the completely wrong KPIs for the system. The pass rate in public examinations seems to be the most important KPI. From primary to graduation and beyond, the power of rote learning gets emphasized one way or another. This is affecting the whole society. But the negative impact in the software development industry can readily be seen.

Programming is completely based on logic and the ability to think and visualize. The current education system of the country is hell bent on destroying these abilities of students. Fortunately, the system is not 100% efficient. The few programmers we get are the lucky ones who passed through the system before getting destroyed.

## Brain Drain

This is a major problem in getting and retaining mid level and senior engineers. This shortage in IT skills is a global phenomenon. After getting an experience of 4-5 years, the doors to Australia, Singapore, Germany, Canada and many more open up. Some have lucrative Permanent Residency offers, leading to citizenship. It is hard for a Bangladeshi company to compete salary wise with an Australian company. Even if a local company offered the same salary, the attraction of moving to a  better country is hard to resist for many, if not most.

These are the hardest challenges a Bangladeshi software company needs to solve to be successful. The sliver lining is that it's not impossible. 20 or so companies have managed to solve them to various extents. Others can learn from them. My hope is that many will, and then we will see a marked improvement in our local software industry.
