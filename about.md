I am Mojahedul Hoque Abul Hasanat and this is my personal blog on programming and software development in general.

I have been a Unix and C fan since my teen years. I am lucky that I got a career that I enjoy. Starting as a programmer and a system administrator, I have built large, complex and scalable systems. I have also built teams and helped to build successful companies with thriving engineering cultures.

I want to share my ideas and thoughts in the field of software development through this blog. I hope others in the field will find it useful.

All opinions expressed in this blog are my personal opinions.
